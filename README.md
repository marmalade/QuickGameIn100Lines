Quick Game in 100 Lines
=======================

Example physics+touch game built with Marmalade Quick in under 100
lines of code

Touch anywhere to fire balls. Hit the other balls for points.
Score resets when any balls fall off the screen.

This was built to demonstrate a few fundamental Lua/Quick APIs
including:
- label and sprites
- physics events
- timers
- tweens and onComplete functions
- touch, update and orientation events
- virtual resolution
